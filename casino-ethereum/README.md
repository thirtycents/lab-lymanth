### Modifications:

* Due to network issues, web3 version 0.20.0 could not be successfully installed, therefore the latest version of web3 is used instead. 
* All methods in index.js have been updated to the latest web3 version. Removed the json-loader method from webpack.config.js to correctly read the ABIJson.
*  The test network used is Sepolia
